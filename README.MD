# ChatGPT-4 Test Project - A Side Scrolling Platformer Game 

About 95% of the code has been generated by ChatGPT-4 by OpenAI with some small manual fixes here and there.

ChatGPT-4 was prompted with a basic description for a side-scrolling game and more features and fixes were added by additional prompts.

This side-scrolling platformer game is built using TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. The player controls a character who can move left and right and jump on platforms. The screen scrolls to the right as the player progresses, with new platforms appearing. The game features a background and Mario-like physics.

NOTE this is only tested on Firefox, Chromium based browsers are currently not working.

## Features

-   Player character with left, right, and jump movement
-   Screen scrolling to the right as the player progresses
-   Platforms for the player to jump on
-   Game over screen when the player falls below the game area
-   Restart button on the game over screen

## Features not working correctly at the moment

-   Enemies that move and can be defeated by jumping on them
